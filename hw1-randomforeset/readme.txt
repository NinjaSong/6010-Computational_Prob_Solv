Forest fires simulation
Cellular automata program based on C

Getting Started
There are 2 files: cells.h and main.c, make sure they are in the same folder and then build & run main.c.

Prerequisities
Xcode for MacOS;
Eclipse for Window;
Jinx may be required.

Running the tests
In “cells.h” ,modify the Grid size M, N to change the size for the forest; modify g & f to get results vary in different growth parameter and fire probability.

Test:
M=N=100,
g = 0.5,
f = 0.01,
The initial P you get is around 5000, and then after the first fire, P is around 3500 (3000-4000).
